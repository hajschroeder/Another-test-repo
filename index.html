    <p>
      The intent of this page is for me to work on my

    <p> Here are some things I've been enjoying lately</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Role Playing games, specifically Pathfinder 2e </li>
      <li> The  TV show "What We Do In the Shadows" </li>
      <li> Not working for the USPS anymore </li>
      <li> Spending time with my partner </li>
      <li> The Dune Series of novels </li>
      <li> Learning new skills and hobbies </li>
      </ul>

    <h3> I have a lot of work to do!!! </h3>

    <p>
    Before I started this new chapter in my life, there
    were several changes I needed to make
    </p>

    <p> These were the things I needed to do. </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Admit that I was not happy at my previous job</li>

      </ol>
