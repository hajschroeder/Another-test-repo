  <h1> Sup, Nerds</h1>
  <h2> This is Hans' practice work. Get in, losers! </h2>

    <p>
      The intent of this page is for me to work on my 
      coding skills as they develop. I will likely add to this as I go and learn. 
    </p>

    <p>First, I will create a simlpe list.</p>

    <p> Here are some things I've been enjoying lately</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Role Playing games, specifically Pathfinder 2e </li>
      <li> The  TV show "What We Do In the Shadows" </li>
      <li> Not working for the USPS anymore </li>
      <li> Spending time with my partner </li>
      <li> The Dune Series of novels </li>
      <li> Learning new skills and hobbies </li>
      </ul>

    <h3> I have a lot of work to do!!! </h3>

    <p>
    Before I started this new chapter in my life, there
    were several changes I needed to make
    </p>

    <p> These were the things I needed to do. </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Admit that I was not happy at my previous job</li>
      <li>Determine if a coding program would be right for me</li>
      <li>Choose the right coding program</li>
      <li>Seek new employment</li>
      <li>Quit smoking cigarettes (in progress)</li>
      </ol>
